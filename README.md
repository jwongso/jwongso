- 👋 Hi, I’m a happy father, husband and software engineer.
- 👀 Out of my professional career, I’m interested in finding a new home and experience how my kids grow up.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ASR and looking for a new job.
- 💞️ Other than that, I’m KPI, speed performance obsessed, and looking for any collaboration in something useful or any project to make life easier.
- 📫 If you have any interesting projects, kindly let me know or share it with me. Feel free to send me an email: jsaputra(at)riseup(dot)net

Peace and out!
