- 👋 Hi, I’m a happy father, husband and software engineer.
- 👀 Out of my professional career, I’m interested in finding a new home for me and my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ABAP and SAP eventhough there are two technology areas that I am willing to dive more: Either cryptocurrency OR AI/ML/DL technology.
- 💞️ Other than that, I’m looking for any collaboration in something useful or any project to make life easier.
- 📫 If you have any interesting projects, kindly let me know or share it with me. Feel free to send me an email: juni(at)riseup(dot)net
